## Emerald DAO
### Improvement Proposal #001

Buying and selling is often a pretty emotional act (especially selling) - understandably, there are even more emotions present, when it comes to blue chip CNFTs.
The goal of this DAO is to get a nice and steady grow of value, measured in ADA, over time.
A DAO is a decentralized autonomous ORGANIZATION, so it should also act like an organization and `leave emotions out`!

#### To make this happen, we need three different kinds of policies:
1. General Organization Policy (GOP)
2. Project Selling Policy (PSP)
3. Single Selling Policy (SSP)

**All of them could be organized in form of single tables in a GitHub repository.**

<br>

#### General Organization Policy (GOP)
defines basic stuff, like how much ADA always has to stay in the wallet as "liquidity buffer", etc. <br> 
Table could look for example like this:


| Property | Value |
| :--- | ---: |
| min. ADA value | 10,000 |
| profit ratio treasury/holder | 50/50 |
| reward ratio Genesis/Normal | 2:1 |
| payout rate | 1 month |
| etc. | ... |

<br>

#### Project Selling Policy (PSP)
Ever CNFT project we consider to buy, needs to contain an entry in the PSP.
The PSP defines how many CNFTs of the corresponding project will always be kept (min number), how long they min. must be held (min hold time), what the min. profit
has to be to consider a sale (min profit), on which percentage of profit the CNFT "automatically" will be sold (max profit), etc. <br> 
Table could look for example like this:


| Project | min number | min hold time | min profit | max profit | etc |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SpaceBudz | 3 | 2 months | 100% | 200% | ... |
| ClayMates | 2 | 1 months | 50% | 100% | ... |
| BeerSommelier | 3 | 6 months | 200% | 500% | ... |
| Berry | 1 | 12 months | 500% | NAN | ... |

<br>

#### Single Selling Policy (SSP)
If the properties for a specific CNFT should be different than defined in the PSP, it has to have an entry in the SSP. So this would be optional for each CNFT. <br> 
Table could look for example like this:


| CNFT | AssetID | min hold time | min profit | max profit | etc |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SpaceBud#9999 | asset16ehm8cl0easdasdasdasdasdwgeg34t643ehb | 6 months | 200% | 500% | ... |
| BeerSommelierSeries3No25 | asset16ehm8cl0easdasdasdasdasdwgeg34t643ehb | 12 months | 1000% | 2000% | ... |
| BerryGreen | asset16ehm8cl0easdasdasdasdasdwgeg34t643ehb | 60 months | 5000% | NAN | ... |

<br>

Think this would lead to less emotions and a steady income for this whole DAO. <br>
